# Milestone 2 Progress

In this milestone, I have made significant progress in setting up the project structure and developing the frontend and backend components. Below is a summary of the work completed:

## Project Folder Structure

  - `frontend/`: Contains the React app and all related files for the user interface.
  - `backend/`: Contains the Node.js server and the backend setup for API integration in future milestones.

## Frontend Development
- Set up a React application for the frontend using Vite.
- Created and styled a **functional Login Page** with the following features:
  - Email and password input fields.
